|*kinetic* |https://github.com/GeorgiaCyber/kinetic[GitHub Page] |_January 2016 to Present_
3+a|This project ended up becoming the official training environment for the United States Army Cyber School.
It has several notable characteristics:

* Apache 2.0 Licensed
* No humans required for day-to-day operation
* Code-driven
* No proprietary components
* Leverages software development lifecycle concepts to comply with policy requirements.

This system has 100% of its life-cycle operations completely automated.
Standing up, tearing down, expanding, and contracting the various modular components of the system can be set to either occur after automated triggers or via a human sending a single command.
All configurations are designed to be stored in public version control and abide by Kerckhoffs's principle and Shannonâ€™s maxim: a system should be secure even when everything about the system, except shared secrets and private keys, are known.
This design facilitates 100% end-to-end auditability, easily identifiable misconfigurations and configuration drift, limitless scaling, and a very lean support staff when compared to traditional solutions.
Furthermore, the mandate that all curriculum be stored in a machine-readable format means that curriculum managers can easily track the state of their curriculum and associated labs by individual line and easily roll back any detrimental changes.
They can operate with 100% confidence knowing that everyone always has the latest version of all course material.

Beyond the current usage in the Classroom, there are significant opportunities for the system to be used in:

* Vulnerability Research
* Testing
* Fuzzing
* Data Analytics

|*Courseware as Code* |Frontiers in Education Conference |_October 2018_
3+|*Abstract:* This Innovative Practice Category Work In Progress presents a case of creating and managing courseware as code.
By managing all content for five central courses in machine-readable markup language within a GitLab instance, our school achieves rapid synchronized collaboration.
Through GitLab, we facilitate change discussions, provide transparency in updates, and allow faculty, students, and even our workforce to identify issues and suggest content.
This enables space for necessary, creative, and even innovative changes by giving all users a voice in the change process and setting a culture of contribution.
In its first year, Courseware as Code enabled over 250 students in 30 classes to benefit from standardized yet flexible and up-to-date content. For our core cyber technical course, 29 instructors over up to three geographically disparate locations stayed engaged with 5,085 commits and 113 issues raised and discussed.
To our knowledge, no other similarly sized and divided group of instructors has achieved this level of collaboration towards synchronized courseware.
